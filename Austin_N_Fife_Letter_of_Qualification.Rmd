Dear Members of the Search Committee:

My name is Austin N. Fife and I believe that my expertise with arthropod-plant-pathosystems, insect/mite identification, statistical analysis with R software, and knowledge of chemical ecology make me a strong candidate for the position of Research Associate - SP003058P:


### Required Experience	
#### Two years of post-bachelor’s research experience in entomology or a related field.
I have a PhD from the University of Florida in Entomology and Nematology, and a MS in Entomology from the University of Idaho

### Required Education	
#### Bachelor of Science degree in entomology, nematology, plant pathology, or a related field.
See above.

### Required Licensures, Certifications or other	
### Must have a valid driver’s license and be able to successfully pass a driver’s record check.
I have a valid FL driver's license

### Hold an Idaho Pesticide Applicator’s License or obtain one within six months of start date.
I have a Florida Pesticide Applicator's License, and I could obtain one from Idaho if offered the position

#### Additional Preferred	
### MS degree in Entomology or closely related field.
As previously stated, I have a PhD and a MS in Entomology


### Experience in identification of insects to species.
I am capable of identifying many insects and mites to species

### Experience in experimental design and analysis of scientific data using SAS or R.
I used R and the tidyverse packages frequently to create, curate, manipulate, analyze and validate data during the past six years of my MSc and PhD in Entomology

### Making insecticide applications to field plots.
I have conducted various field trials which required pesticide applications

### Experience with molecular tools such as PCR and ELISA.
I have followed basic PCR protocols to verify the presence of viruses in plant tissues. I do not have direct experience with ELISA, but I understand the basic concepts, and I expect to be able to learn the process quickly.

### Publishing in peer-refereed journals.
I have extensive experience writing technical documents of varying lengths and formats: My research has been published as 2 articles in peer-reviewed journals, a technical report, I also have a manuscript accepted for publication in the Journal of Integrated Pest Management. I have written over six abstracts for conferences, and I have written grant applications, one of which was funded (see CV).


### Ability to communicate clearly verbally and in writing, and to maintain clear, detailed records.
My six years of experience with Research and Extension Centers has allowed me to communicate with fellow scientists, stakeholders, and the public at over 11 conferences as well as more informal settings like 4-H meetings. I also speak, read and write Spanish fluently, which permits a wider audience to access our research.
I have collaborated frequently with over 10 principal investigators from regional universities, state and governmental agencies. I have a manuscript accepted with revisions to the Journal of Integrated Pest Management, with ten authors.

### Ability to work alone and cooperatively in an effective and efficient manner with minimal supervision.
I have had multiple opportunities to work remotely with minimal supervision: I was a visiting student researcher at the lab of a collaborator in Georgia, and I would be working alone for days while I set up and managed our field trials. I also conducted surveys of roses along the Florida-Georgia border, often driving alone for hours and staying overnight at hotels as needed.

#### Physical Requirements	
### Must be able to lift, carry, and/or otherwise move heavy materials weighing up to 60 pounds.
I am able to lift, carry and otherwise move heavy materials up to 60 pounds

### Working Conditions	
### Occasionally required to work with toxic, volatile, and corrosive chemicals and/or carcinogenic substances, with proper Personal Protective Equipment provided.
I am able to follow PPE regulations, and I have experience handling toxic, volatile, corrosive and/or carcinogenic substances.

### Occasionally required to work in adverse environmental conditions (dusty, hot, or cold conditions outdoors).
I am able to work in adverse environmental conditions.

#### Degree Requirement	Listed degree qualification is required at time of application.
Included

In conclusion, I believe that my experience with entomological research in the Pacific Northwest make me a well-qualified candidate for this position.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

--Austin N. Fife
