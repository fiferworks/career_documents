I have experience curating data from lab and field studies during my graduate degrees in Entomology. I used R and the tidyverse packages frequently to clean and validate data, including a large project with 'dirty' data, which was comprised of over 50 .csv files which were imported en mass and merged into a single data sheet for analysis.

#### Experience in working with tabular data.
I have experience creating, curating, manipulating and analyzing tabular data in R and Excel almost daily with various tidyverse packages for the execution of over six scientific research projects.

#### Experience with spreadsheet software.
I use Excel, Google Sheets frequently, and Libre/Open Office occasionally.

#### Experience with written communications such as reports, manuscripts, conference abstracts, and grant applications.
I have published a technical report, I have a manuscript in revisions for the Journal of Integrated Pest Management, I have created and presented conference abstracts at over six scientific conferences, and I have written a few grant applications, one of which was funded (see CV).

#### Experience using git for version control.
I rely on git and GitHub daily for version control of my code, data, and manuscripts.

#### Experience in bulk import of files, merging data sets, automated error checking using command line software such as R, bash, python, or OpenRefine.
I have imported large numbers of files, merged data sets and checked for errors with R and the tidyverse package for each of my major research projects. I also am familiar with bash, and have a basic understanding of Python.

#### Experience in R Programming with R base commands and the R Tidyverse.
I program with R daily to accomplish my research needs. I rely on a combination of base R functions, and I use the R Tidyverse for the majority of my research projects.

#### Experience collaborating with others.
I have collaborated frequently with over 10 principal investigators from regional universities, state and governmental agencies.

Preferred qualifications:

#### Experience in instructional delivery.
I presented topics on Support Vector Machines and Principal Component Analysis for a book club I attended about Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in R. I have tutored Spanish conversation classes. I presented research to various audiences, including scientists, stakeholders and the public at over 11 conferences, and club meetings. I taught a class at local 4-H club, organized activities and encouraged handling of live insects during the 6th and 7th Tallahassee Science Festivals, led activities at two NFREC-Quincy Arts \& Garden Festivals as well as NFREC Agriculture Adventures and Ecology Field days
