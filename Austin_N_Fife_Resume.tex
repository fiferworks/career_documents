\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
	
	\textbf{Research Assistant - University of Florida} \hfill {\em \textit{18 Jul 2018 - 31 Dec 2021}}\\
% - Cleaned and analyzed multidimensional data produced from analysis of volatile organic compounds via paired Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS).\\
- Surveyed and mapped mite populations (phenology) in the field in northern Florida and southern Georgia.\\
%- Collected data at alternative sites after use of viral resources became restricted due to pest quarantine by the state agencies.\\
- Collaborated with over 10 Principal Investigators from plant pathology and entomology departments from the University of Florida, the University of Georgia, the USDA-ARS and the FDACS. Followed state and USDA permits, complied with state restrictions for movement of mites and viruses\\
 - Trained lab technicians in data entry, methodologies, and standard operating procedures.\\
 - Presented research to various audiences, including scientists, stakeholders and the public at over 11 conferences, and club meetings.\\
 - Taught class at local 4-H club, organized activities and encouraged handling of live insects during the 6th and 7th Tallahassee Science Festivals, led activities at NFREC-Quincy Arts \& Garden Festival as well as NFREC Agriculture Adventures and Ecology Field days.\\
 -  Analyzed data with statistical methods in R, including principal component analyses (PCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi-squared tests and Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling (GLMM). \\
 %- Authored and published 2 journal articles (one in revisions), a technical report, as well as multiple lab protocols and standard operating procedures with RMarkdown.\\
 %- Presented chapters on support vector machines (SVM) and PCA for university book club about Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in R.

\textbf{Research Assistant - University of Idaho} \hfill {\em \textit{15 Apr 2015 - 18 Dec 2018}}\\
- Studied host plant selection of the potato psyllid \textit{Bactericera cockerelli}, vector of Zebra Chip Disease in potato.\\
- Maintained four insect colonies, grew 100+ plants in the greenhouse, including 10 varieties of potato, tomatoes, eggplant, weeds and various species of native plants from seed\\
- Used statistical methods in R to interpret data, including t-tests, ANOVA, and GLMMs.\\
- Developed protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs), to record insect behaviors and fecundity on living plants with a limited budget.\\
- Assisted in pest monitoring by processing hundreds of sticky traps weekly.\\
- Wrote and published thesis with Latex.\\
- Manually sorted and weighed 70+ lb sacks of potatoes with a small team.\\

\textbf{Research \& Teaching Assistant - BYU - Idaho} \hfill {\em \textit{13 Apr 2013 - 15 Apr 2015}}\\
- Drove an Off-road vehicle to navigate sand dunes and record coordinates of \textit{Cicindela arenicola}, the St. Anthony Dunes Tiger Beetle to study habitat characteristics, range, and dispersal.\\
- Independently obtained permit from National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management Craters of the Moon National Monument to collect data on a threatened species of beetle, \textit{Glacicavicola bathysciodes}\\
- Prepared daily labs and mentored students\\
